## Hi! I'am Antu 👋
Hey! I am a young boy attending the **fourth year of high school** in the computer science class. I've been passionate about this **since 2019** when i was in middle school. I started by programming the Arduino. Later I learned to program in **Python (which I have mastered)**, At school I learned to program in **C++ (where again I have a high level of skill)** and to develop **Front-end sites (In fact I can write sites using HTML, CSS and the JS)**. Now to face the fourth year of the school I have already started learning **Java (although it is still at the basics, and I already have a little skill, already able to write small codes)**. Exact same situation for the **LUA, I'm learning it for personal reasons**, for a small project on StormWorks 😆

### My goals and my projects 🏆
In the past I have participated in multiple national and international competitions. **In 2022**, together with my team, **we reached the final of the Italian Robotics Championships** and we are hosted by the [**IIT (Italian Institute of Technology) in Genoa**](iit.it). I also participated in **AstroPi**, an international competition organized by [**ESA (European Space Agency)**](esa.int). I also participated in minor but equally important experiences such as the **NaoChallenge**, at [**FAI (Fondo Ambiete Italiano)**](fondoambiente.it) where I programmed a small (but large and very expensive) robot capable of managing hospitality, and finally (among the thousands of experiences I have done) I programmed a robot capable of giving a presentation during the **171 anniversary of the Italian state police**. In the past I had created a small project called [**CatNet**](https://github.com/AronkyTechnologies/Cat-Net) which was simply a suite of network-tools, now I have put this open-source project aside to **focus on other things** 😁

## For the future? 🔮
Uh. **No one knows what the future holds for the rest of us**. But I will definitely continue my studies in information technology and increase all my skills. **Only time will tell us what I will do** 😹
